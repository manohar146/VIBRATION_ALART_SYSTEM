# VIBRATION_ALART_SYSTEM
This project continuously monitors vibration levels using a vibration sensor, displays real-time readings on a 16x2 I2C LCD, and classifies the system state as SAFE or DANGER based on a predefined thresholdâ€”activating a green LED and displaying "Status: SAFE" when vibration is low, and triggering a blinking red LED, buzzer alert, and "Status: DANGER!!"
